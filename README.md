Summary 

This repository contains all the code, SQL queries, and visualizations from my first portfolio project. The project involves creating an e-commerce database, analyzing the data using SQL, and visualizing the results using Tableau.

Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of an e-commerce database, focusing on key performance metrics that are crucial for business decision-making. The SQL queries cover a range of analyses, from product performance to customer behavior, while the Tableau dashboard offers a visual summary of these insights.

How to Use This Repository

Data Setup:
Ensure you have a running instance of a SQL database (e.g., MySQL).
Load the e-commerce database schema and data.

Running SQL Queries:
Use a SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench) to run the queries in the order provided to explore different aspects of the data. Each query is self-contained and can be executed individually to generate specific insights.

Visualizing Data in Tableau:
The analysis results are visualized in Tableau. Access the Tableau dashboard to interact with the data and draw insights.
